Authors since :ref:`5.0.0`: Jordi Torrents (jordi.torrents@research.fchampalimaud.org | jordi.torrentsm@gmail.com)

idtrackerai-detectron2 (this fork)
==================================

Changes made in `this fork <https://github.com/mbel-tech/idtrackerai-detectron2>`_
and not present in upstream idtracker.ai. They are described at length in
``VALIDATOR.md`` and ``README.md`` in the repository root, and in
``docs/detectron2-pipeline.md``.

Validator changes
-----------------

- New ``Swap with...``, ``Extend...`` and ``Merge with...`` operations in the
  double-click dialog, backed by new ``Blob.swap_identity()``,
  ``Blob.propagate_swap_identity()`` and ``ListOfBlobs.merge_blobs()``.
- Undo the last twenty edits with :kbd:`Ctrl+Z`.
- A failed save now writes the session to ``~/idtrackerai_backups`` and reports
  it, rather than losing the work silently on a worker thread.
- Autosave every five minutes, without progress dialogs.
- New ``presence_intervals`` session parameter: frames in which an identity is
  not expected to exist stop being reported as missing-identity errors.
- Minimum-duration and identity-pair filters on the list of errors, and a
  next-error button bound to :kbd:`N`.
- New PCHIP interpolation mode, which cannot overshoot between fixed points.
  The default interpolation order is now linear. :kbd:`Enter` applies an
  interpolation, :kbd:`I` starts one, and clicking a fixed point jumps to its
  frame.
- The length calibration line now follows the cursor. Fixed deleting the wrong
  calibration when two of them read the same, and fixed a calibration restored
  from disk raising ``AttributeError``.
- Holding a frame-step key scrubs through the video instead of stepping once.
- New Video Info tab.

Segmentation changes
--------------------

- New ``external_contours`` session parameter: animal outlines are read from a
  sidecar file produced by an external instance-segmentation model instead of
  being found by thresholding. It takes one file per video path, so a
  recording saved in several clips is tracked as one session with identities
  carried across the joins. The Segmentation App pairs files to clips by name,
  which makes the order right by construction, and refuses rather than
  tracking part of a session when a clip has no file.
- The Segmentation App gains a segmentation-source selector and a guided panel
  for sampling frames, annotating them and building a Detectron2 dataset.
- The preparation panel keeps its own list of videos to draw annotation frames
  from, separate from the videos being tracked, so one model can be trained
  across every recording from a setup while each recording is tracked on its
  own. It shows the per-video allocation before sampling and warns when the
  frame count is too low for every video to be represented.
- The train/validation split now groups clips by recording rather than by file,
  folding pieces such as ``trial_segment_1/2/3`` together. The inferred
  grouping is shown before the dataset is built and can be overridden, with
  ``--group-by`` on the command line.
- Fixed sampled frames recording their source video inconsistently, which let
  frames from one clip be counted as two sources and placed on both sides of
  the train/validation split. Re-sampling into a folder now adds to its
  manifest instead of replacing it.
- Fixed the frame budget being concentrated on one clip rather than spread
  across them, and a single unreadable file aborting a whole sampling run.
  Clips whose file names would collide are now refused before anything is
  written.
- Training and contour export are steps in the Segmentation App, not only
  instructions to go elsewhere. The panel checks whether this machine has a
  CUDA GPU and Detectron2; when it does, training runs here as a managed
  subprocess with its output shown and a stop button, without importing
  Detectron2 into the GUI process. The export is handed over as a command,
  because roughly an hour per 30 000-frame clip means days over a collection.
  Colab is now the fallback for machines without a GPU rather than the route.
- The Colab notebook now runs a whole project rather than only the two GPU
  stages: it points at every clip from one setup, previews the enhancement,
  samples frames across all of them, and after you annotate them locally takes
  them back, builds the dataset, trains, exports contours, and writes one
  idtracker.ai parameter file per recording. Those files inherit the
  configuration saved by the Segmentation App, so the animal count, area
  thresholds, region of interest and tracking interval carry over. Annotation
  stays local because LabelMe is a desktop application and a runtime has no
  display. A section that tracks on the runtime is included and marked as
  untested there.
- New ``idtrackerai_d2_install_gpu`` command, and a button in step 5, that
  installs PyTorch and Detectron2 for the machine they run on: the GPU and its
  CUDA version are detected, the matching PyTorch index is chosen and checked
  to exist, and the commands are shown before anything runs. Neither package
  can be an ordinary dependency -- PyPI's PyTorch wheel for Windows is
  CPU-only, so declaring it would silently disable the GPU for idtracker.ai's
  own identity tracking, and Detectron2 is not on PyPI at all and builds from
  source, so declaring it would make installation fail on any machine without
  a compiler.
- The Segmentation App's left column scrolls. It asks for more height than a
  laptop screen has, and the layout answered that by shrinking every widget
  below its natural size, which left a preparation step too short to show its
  own button.
- Fixed the Colab notebook aborting on every freshly built bundle: its
  integrity check looked for ``tools/frame_preprocessing.py``, a name the
  bundle has never written. Repaired its markdown cells, whose stored lines
  had lost their line endings so each cell rendered as one run-on paragraph,
  and updated the script names the fork has since replaced with installed
  ``idtrackerai_d2_*`` commands.
- New ``enhancement`` session parameter. Frame enhancement (CLAHE and
  correction for uneven lighting) is chosen against the footage in the
  Segmentation App, with a live preview and named presets, and applies in
  every segmentation mode: to the frames, to the background model and to the
  identification images alike. It is off by default. Turning it on shifts the
  brightness range, so intensity thresholds chosen against raw frames need
  re-tuning; the app says so next to the thresholds.
- The pipeline that produces the contour files ships inside the package, as
  ``idtrackerai.extra_tools.detectron2_pipeline``, so the GUI and the command
  line run the same code. Every stage is also an installed
  ``idtrackerai_d2_*`` command.

Packaging changes
-----------------

- Distributed as ``idtrackerai-detectron2``. The import name is unchanged, so
  it cannot be installed alongside upstream idtracker.ai.
- Fixed the version lookup failing under the fork's distribution name, which
  made the package raise at import time once installed, and made every
  tracking run raise before it started.

6.0.0
=====

- The Protocol 3 (used as a fallback of Protocol 2) has been removed and Contrastive Protocol has been introduced as the new main identification protocol leaving Accumulation Protocol (Protocol 2) as a fallback to run if Contrastive fails (publication in progress).

- The different trajectories files have been merged into one single file.

- Fix Validator bug when acting on a centroid that has a duplicated identity.
- Fix and speed up blob-to-blob overlapping check.
- The default value for ``number_of_parallel_workers`` is limited to maximum 4 since the parallelized tasks involve disk read and write operations that are not CPU bound.

- Hardcoded ``LEARNING_RATE_IDCNN_ACCUMULATION`` to 0.005.
- Default Multiprocessing start method to ``forkserver`` when possible.
