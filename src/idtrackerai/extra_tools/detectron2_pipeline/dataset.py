"""Turning LabelMe polygons into a COCO instance-segmentation dataset.

Annotations are validated rather than trusted. LabelMe will happily save a
two-point "polygon", a shape drawn outside the image, or a label typo that
silently becomes a second class, and each of those either crashes training or
quietly degrades it. Everything found is reported rather than raised, so the
caller — a terminal or a GUI panel — can show the whole picture at once.

The split defaults to grouping by source video. Frames sampled from one clip a
few seconds apart show the same animals in nearly the same poses, so a random
split puts near-duplicates in both train and validation, and the validation AP
then measures memorisation rather than generalisation.
